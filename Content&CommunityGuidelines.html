        <br />

        <br />
        <p>a. Adherence to Applicable Laws</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          All the content, including without limitation, content that is

        <br />
        <p>b. Nudity and Pornography</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We allow content that has limited sexual imagery, provided it is
          posted for artistic value, educational purposes, awareness, protest,
          humor, or satirical purposes. Content that contains the following is
          against these Guidelines:

        <br />
        <p>
          i. sexually explicit, pornographic, or nude material or images/videos

          prostitution or escort services);
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>c. Harassment or Bullying</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Try to ignore any content that you may find petty and annoying. But do
          report any content that harasses another person or degrades or shames
          anyone.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Posting abuses or curse words, morphed images, malicious recordings,
          objectifying someone, making sexual advances, or otherwise engaging in
          sexual misconduct will not be tolerated. Similarly, extorting or
          blackmailing any person is prohibited. If someone blocks you from
          their account, do not try to contact them from another account.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If, however, a matter involves a critical discussion of people
          featured in the news or who have a large public audience, we may allow
          it.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>e. Violence</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This includes all content that causes discomfort to our users due to
          the goriness in the content, such as graphical images or videos that
          glorify violence, or intends to incite violence, or encourages
          dangerous and illegal activities, or praises groups or leaders
          involved in terrorism, organized violence or criminal activities.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Educative or informative content on violence may be allowed provided
          that it is captioned in detail and contains warnings for violent
          content.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Post violent content only if your intent is to provide information,
          education, or spread awareness. Warn your audience!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>f. Hate Speech and Propaganda</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Content that intimidates any person or promotes violent behavior,
          targets or demeans any particular religion, caste, ethnicity,
          community, disability (physical or mental), age or gender, is
          prohibited. Any kind of content which produces hatred or has the
          intention of creating or spreading hatred or hate propaganda along the
          lines of religion, caste, ethnicity, community, age or gender is also
          not allowed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Refrain from incendiary commentary and publishing theories that may
          appall our users and influence them negatively.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We encourage that you express your opinion, but think before you
          write. Remember that this is a social platform!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>g. Abuse, Self-Injury or Suicide</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Posting any content that relates to physical, sexual, or psychological
          maltreatment, neglect, or abuse of a person, be it that of a child or
          an adult, is prohibited. Posts showcasing self-harm, injury, or
          suicide or provoking anyone to commit self-harm are also not allowed.
          Further, posts that identify, tag, and negatively target victims or
          survivors of abuse, self-injury, or domestic or similar violence are
          also prohibited.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Foster some care in the society and maintain our supportive
          environment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>h. Illegal Activities</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We have zero tolerance for content or activities that advocate or
          promote illegal activities. Content related to organized crime,
          violence, or terrorist activities is not allowed. Sale of illegal
          goods or services, regulated goods, drugs, and soliciting or selling
          of sexual services is strictly forbidden.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Do not post tutorials or instructions on content that educates the
          users on illegal activities (such as making bombs or doing drugs). Do
          not promote online gambling, online real money games of skill, or
          online lotteries. Do not use our Platform to solicit or facilitate any
          transaction or gift involving goods and services which are declared
          illegal by the Government of India
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Impersonating another person (such as your friends, celebrities, or
          brands) and distributing false or misleading information on our
          Platform to make personal or financial gains is fraud.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Brochill does not let you conduct any activities that the law
          prohibits.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>i. Non-Consensual (Personal) Content</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Any kind of personal content of another person, including pictures or
          videos of people who will not appreciate such material being posted,
          is not allowed. Basically, do not post anyone’s personal or intimate
          photos or videos without their permission or consent. We will remove
          such content.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Revealing someone’s personal data or sensitive personal data,
          including without limitation, phone number, address, financial
          information, Aadhar Number, and Passport information, or threatening
          someone using this information, will be considered as harassing them,
          and such activities are unacceptable.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Other people’s personal information is not yours to share.</p>
        <br />
        <p>j. Spam</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          False advertisements, fraudulent or misleading representations, and
          security breaches, all fall under the ambit of commercial spam. They
          deter other users from sharing and connecting. It is important that
          the content you share be authentic and help create a safe environment
          for people to post on the Platform. Do not post the same content
          multiple times if it intends to annoy viewers or sell goods/services
          or gain followers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you want to promote your goods or services, do so in a civilized
          manner adhering to our Content Marketing Policies.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Allow your friends and other users to use the Platform the way you
          would like to use it. Don’t spam!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>k. Fake News</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Any kind of content which spreads deliberate misinformation, hoaxes,
          or fake propaganda, with the intent to mislead, is not permitted. We
          prohibit the posting of content that exaggerates an existing piece of
          news by introducing non-factual elements into it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you intend to mislead our users or attempt to create a sensation by
          straight-up fabricating content or attempt to damage someone’s
          reputation or hurt their financial or political standing on the basis
          of false information, we will not let it spread on our Platform.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Don’t worry though. We don’t confuse fake news with any satire or
          parodies. We know they are to amuse, and not to mislead.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you have posted something equivalent to fake news, whether
          intentionally or unintentionally, remove it as soon as possible.
          Satyamev Jayate!

        <br />

        <p>b. Stay on Topic</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Brochill is a very active platform. Many posts go up, many discussions
          take place. Make sure that any content that you post, and any
          discussion you participate in, relates to the caption and tags of the
          post. Content that does not relate to the caption or tags, or is
          unreasonable for a particular post, will be removed. Don’t go
          off-track.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>c. Be Polite and Courteous</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We expect you to conduct yourself with integrity and harmoniously on
          our Platform. Show courtesy and respect to fellow users. Don’t be
          rude. We advise you to not initiate or participate in any activity
          which is not in good faith for the community at large.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>d. Multiple/Fake Profiles</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Creating a fake profile of someone or impersonating someone in a
          misleading or deceiving manner, with or without the intention of
          harassing or bullying them, is not allowed. Community profiles,
          informative profiles, and fan profiles of public figures may be
          allowed. Satire or parody accounts of public figures are acceptable if
          it has been clearly mentioned in the profile description or profile
          status.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>e. Right Choice of Words</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Brochill is a multilingual platform. Certain words that may seem
          acceptable to you, when translated to another tongue, may become
          offensive. We do not ask that you translate and test every post into
          all the different languages. All we ask is that you weigh your words
          carefully. Content that contains profanity that is used to insult,
          antagonize or inflame other users will be held for review. Depending
          on the context of the post, it may be removed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>f. Safety and Security</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Harassing someone or using abuses in the posts or comments while
          addressing a user is not allowed. Do not do anything which can make
          any other users feel that Brochill is not a safe platform to use.
          Action will be taken against you if you try to create hostile
          situations for any other user.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>g. Beware of Legal Consequences</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Unawareness of law is not an excuse. Note that for using our Platform,
          you will need to comply with laws that govern online conduct. Respect
          all applicable laws while using our Platform. Any activity featuring,
          encouraging, offering, or soliciting illegal activities will not be
          tolerated.

        <br />
        <p>h. Evading Suspension</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our decision to suspend any account is binding. Any attempt to
          circumvent the suspension by using other accounts, identities,
          personalities, or presence on another user’s account will also result
          in suspension. If you try to evade suspension, we may be compelled to
          terminate your account with us and block you from registering with us.
